# Overview

Truv's integration with LenderLogix LiteSpeed provides instant access to borrowers' employment and income details directly from verified payroll accounts. This integration enables quick and accurate verification within seconds, enhancing the speed and efficiency of decision-making.

# Key Benefits

* **Instant Verification**: Quickly verify employment and income details.
* **Reliable Data**: Access trustworthy information from reputable payroll providers.
* **Streamlined Process**: Improve underwriting efficiency and decision-making speed.

# How it works

During the loan application process, once borrowers or co-borrowers have submitted their information, they are prompted to connect their payroll accounts through Truv by clicking **Verify Employment**.

1. **Borrower Connects Accounts**: Borrowers are guided to securely link their payroll accounts.
2. **Truv Generates Reports**: Verification reports are automatically generated and made available in all leading Loan Origination Systems (LOS), such as Encompass®. Reports, including pay stubs, W-2s, and borrower-level documents, are added to the Encompass eFolder, along with other payroll documents.
3. **Ongoing Monitoring**: Connected payroll accounts are monitored for updates, allowing new reports to be generated throughout the loan process.
