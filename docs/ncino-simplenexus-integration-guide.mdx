# Overview

Integrate **Truvâ€™s Verification of Income and Employment (VOI/E)** solution with **nCino's point-of-sale system** to streamline and secure the process of accessing borrowers' income and employment data.

# Key Benefits

* **Seamless Verification**: Effortlessly confirm employment and income details.
* **Accurate Data**: Retrieve precise information from verified sources.
* **Faster Decisions**: Accelerate the verification process for quicker decision-making.
* **Comprehensive Access**: Ensure a smooth experience with complete access to essential borrower data.

# How it works

There are 2 ways to use Truv within the nCino Mortgage Suite Platform

* **Truv Embedded Workflow:** Enable Truv within the loan pre-application workflow. Borrower/co-borrowers are able to complete Income, Employment, Assets verification as they complete their application.
* **Truv Notifications Workflow:** In this integration, borrowers/co-borrowers are notified(via email & SMS) immediately as they complete their pre-application. Once Income, Employment, Assets verification are completed reports, files and documents are returned to both POS & LOS automatically.

## Truv Embedded Workflow

1. **Pre-Application Stage**: Borrowers and co-borrowers are prompted to connect their payroll accounts in the Verify Income and/or Verify Assets section of their loan application using Truv.
2. **Account Connection**: Once accounts are linked, Truv provides reports within your chosen Loan Origination System (LOS).
3. **Ongoing Monitoring**: Linked accounts are continuously monitored for new payroll documents, generating updated verification reports throughout the mortgage loan origination process.

## Truv Notifications Workflow

1. **Pre-Application Stage**: Borrowers and co-borrowers complete their pre-application.

2. **Notifications Step**: Upon application submission, borrowers and co-borrowers are notified via email and text notifications to complete their Income, Employment and Asset verification.

   * Products are configured in Templates in Truv Dashboard.
   * Based on the Templates used, borrowers are prompted to verify income or employment or assets or both.

3. **Account Connection**: Once accounts are linked, Truv provides reports within your chosen Loan Origination System (LOS).

Refer to the [detailed step-by-step guide](/docs/simplenexus-notiifcations-workflow-integration-guide) to configure Truv Notifications Workflow.
