# Evaluate your current process

Truv retrieves all employment data related to a payroll account. You can then use that data throughout your application process.

* **Pre-qualification** - Check eligibility for pre-qualification as well as for mortgages. You can autofill any information including personal and employment information.
* **Verification** - Verify employment or income after decision-making or pre-qualification. This use case is common for consumer loans, including auto and personal loans.
* **Continuous access** - Use Truv for consistent access to payroll and employment data. This makes it simpler to automatically update your system.

# User onboarding and off-boarding

Our intuitive user interface and user experience improves conversion rates compared to traditional methods. Your user experience is more successful when connecting to your user’s payroll with a streamlined setup. Establish a simple and straightforward process with these benefits.

You can also let users manage their account. With this option, they can disconnect and delete data from the system as needed.

# Continuous access for most recent user data

Truv's platform can notify your system when proactively pulling income and employment data. Receive notifications when any user information changes, such as a new paystub or employment status.

For example, when connections to a specific session expires, you can set up a user workflow to return to the application. This lets users re-authenticate with Truv Bridge and connect again, depending on the payroll system.

# Using Orders

Truv Orders let you contact users to connect their provider information. These solutions are secure, simple, and customizable ways to integrate Truv into your workflow.

The VOIE product also has Order integrations with third party platforms. Use the guide below to learn more.
