# Evaluate your current process

Truv retrieves all employment data related to a payroll account. You can then use that data throughout your application process.

* **After Verification of Income and Employment** - After verifying income and employment, have users decide and allocate part of their paycheck from their payroll.
* **Continuous access** - Use Truv for consistent access to payroll and employment data. This makes it simpler to automatically update your system.

# User onboarding and off-boarding

Our intuitive user interface and user experience improves conversion rates compared to traditional methods. Your user experience is more successful when connecting to your userâ€™s payroll with a streamlined setup. Establish a simple and straightforward process with these benefits.

You can also let users manage their account. With this option, they can disconnect and delete data from the system as needed.

# Continuous access for most recent user data

Truv's platform can notify your system when proactively pulling income and employment data. Receive notifications when any user information changes, such as a new paystub or employment status.

For example, when connections to a specific session expires, you can set up a user workflow to return to the application. This lets users re-authenticate with Truv Bridge and connect again, depending on the payroll system.
