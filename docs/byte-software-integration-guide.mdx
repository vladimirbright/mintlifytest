# How it works

The Truv integration within BYTE Software allows you to leverage automated employment and income verification directly in your existing workflow. Here’s how it works:

1. **Application Submission**: Operations team can initiate and submit the loan application through BYTE Software.
2. **Request Verification**: Simply navigate to the Truv verification section and input the necessary information for the applicant.
3. **Borrower Notification**: Borrowers are notified via email and text, specified in the loan application to complete the requested verifications. The borrower experience is completely customized through the Truv Dashboard -> Templates. Borrower is required to authenticate into the employers requested to complete the verification.
4. **Automated Data Retrieval**: Once borrower completes the requested verification. Truv retrieves the income and employment data from connected payroll systems and the data retrieved is automatically populated in BYTE Software, allowing for a seamless continuation of the loan process.
