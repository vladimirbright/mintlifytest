### Adding Document Mappings Manually

Encompass® also supports uploading a .csv file with the **Document Types** to **eFolder Document Folder** mapping in two columns.

* Download the document mapping template within Encompass
* Enter the Truv **Document Types** in Column A (using the same naming convention as above)
* Enter the Encompass **eFolder Document Folders** in Column B
* Save the file and then upload to Encompass® to import the mapping directly into Encompass
* Click the **Save** button on the bottom right to save the mapping

## Sending Documents to Unassigned eFolder

As an additional option, lenders can request for all returned documents to be sent to the *Unassigned* eFolder, instead of the default *Verifications* eFolder or any custom mapped options. This gives lenders the ability to route documents manually to folders as they appear.

Reach out to the Truv Implementation team for assistance in configuring this option.

# Additional Configuration Settings in Encompass®

* **Don't update employment data**: When checked, this feature allows the Truv verification to be uploaded into Encompass® without overwriting the existing employment information in Form 1003. For some customers, it is important to upload the Truv report, paystubs, and W-2s without modifying the existing data in Encompass®.
* **Don't send SMS**: When checked, Truv will not send any SMS notifications to the borrower.
* **Hide VOE/VOIE report for doc upload**: When a Truv verification is successful, the Truv report, along with the paystubs and W-2s, is uploaded into Encompass®. However, for some customers, if the connection to the payroll provider is unsuccessful, manual document uploads require additional checks. In such cases, they prefer not to upload the Truv report, as it may give a false sense of verification. Instead, they only want the manually uploaded documents to be added to Encompass® for the lender's review.
* **Don't upload paystubs**: When checked, PDF paystubs will not be uploaded to Encompass®.
* **Don't upload W2**: When checked, PDF W2s will not be uploaded to Encompass®.
* **Don't upload 1099**: When checked, PDF 1099s will not be uploaded to Encompass®.
* **Don't upload Truv's report**: When checked, the PDF Truv report will not be uploaded to Encompass®.
