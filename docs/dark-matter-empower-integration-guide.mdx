# Overview

The Empower® Loan Origination Platform integrates seamlessly with Truv to enable fast, efficient income and employment verifications. With just a few simple steps, you can transform your verification process and keep everything within your loan origination platform.

# Key Benefits:

* **Real-time Verification of Income and Employment**: Receive accurate reports in seconds, from the start of the application through to closing, with the ability to re-verify employment as needed.
* **On-demand Payroll Documents**: Automatically retrieve borrowers' paystubs and W-2s, eliminating the need for borrowers to provide these manually.
* **Cost Savings**: Save 60–80% on verification costs, including $0 re-verifications.
* **Day 1 Certainty®**: Use Truv with Fannie Mae’s Desktop Underwriter® (DU®) to benefit from representations and warranties relief.

# How It Works

1. **Automated Verification**:

   * Select Truv as the Exchange Verification provider within Empower.

   * Choose from two verification options:

     * Initial Verification of Income and Employment (VOIE)
     * Re-verification of Employment (VOE only)

2. **Borrower Payroll Connection**:

   * Once the verification request is submitted, Truv immediately prompts the borrower to connect their payroll account.
   * Borrowers select their employer through Truv Bridge, authenticate, and securely connect to their payroll account.

3. **Real-Time Document Retrieval**:

   * Truv automatically pulls the borrower's paystubs and W-2s and generates the VOI/VOE reports.
   * These documents are available in real-time in the Empower® Document Repository for easy access.

4. **Streamlined Loan Process**:
   * The entire verification process, from application to closing, is completed in real-time within Empower, streamlining the loan cycle without leaving the platform.

# Enabling the Integration

1. **Contact Empower®:** Reach out to your Empower® account representative to enable Truv’s integration.

2. **Customize the Borrower Flow:** White label the borrower facing experience with Truv Dashboard -> Templates.

3. **Configure in Truv Console:**

   * Once you receive your Party ID from Empower, log into the Truv Dashboard.
   * Navigate to the **Platform Keys** section in Truv Dashboard and select the DMT Empower® integration.
   * Enter your Party ID to enable the integration.

# Ordering a Verification

1. **Start the Verification:**

   * Go to **Exchange Verifications** in a loan file within Empower and click **Begin a New Order (Service Request)**.
   * Select **Truv** as the verification provider.

2. **Select Verification Product:** Choose between the following based on your loan application needs:

   * VOE/VOI (Verification of Employment and Income) for origination request,
   * VOE only (Verification of Employment) for re-verifications.

3. **Input Borrower and Loan Officer Details**:

   * Enter the borrower’s full name, email address, and phone number (if not already auto-populated).
   * In the Loan Information section, input the loan officer’s details and select Processor or Underwriter depending on their role.

4. **Submit the Order:**

   * Click **Validate Submission Data** to ensure all fields are filled.
   * Click **Submit Request**. The order status will update as Ordered submitted and Order acknowledged.

5. **Borrower Action:** After submission, the borrower receives an SMS and email to connect their payroll account using Truv.

# Retrieving Reports and Documents

To view the borrower’s VOI/VOE reports, W-2s, and paystubs, navigate to the Document Repository in Empower once the order is completed.

# Day 1 Certainty® and AIM

Truv’s verification reports can help you achieve Day 1 Certainty® through Fannie Mae’s Desktop Underwriter® (DU®) and Freddie Mac’s AIM (Asset and Income Modeler).

1. **Enable Day 1 Certainty® and AIM**: Contact your Empower® account representative to enable these features.

2. **Configure for Day 1 Certainty®**:

   * Ensure your Empower integration is set up to use Truv with Fannie Mae’s DU validation service and Freddie Mac’s AIM.
   * Update the Verification Providers Display Value to Truv.

3. **Retrieve DU and AIM Information**: After completing a verification, the report will include a reference ID that can be submitted to Fannie Mae for Day 1 Certainty® or to Freddie Mac for AIM eligibility.
