# Overview

When using Truv Bridge to verify a user’s employment and income, you have three main approaches:

1. Single data source
2. Waterfall / Fallbacks
3. Smart Routing

Read on to learn about each option and how to implement it.

# Single data source

Choose a **single data source** if:

* Your program only permits one method of verification, or
* You want to let users pick a verification source and handle that selection in your own application.

Refer to one of the following guides to launch the corresponding Truv Bridge:

* [Payroll Income Verification](./payroll-income-verification#integration-process)
* [Financial Accounts Income Verification](./voie-using-financial-accounts#bridge-token-specifications)
* [Document Processing](./implementing-income-and-employment-document-processing#bridge-token-specifications)

# Waterfall / Fallbacks

A **waterfall** approach presents multiple data sources in a preferred order, ensuring users always have a fallback if one method fails or isn’t applicable. This is highly recommended because it improves conversion rates by increasing the likelihood of a successful verification.

For instance, you might prompt users to try payroll first, but if that fails or is unavailable, prompt them to connect a financial account or upload documents instead.

## Waterfall Implementation

1. When creating a `bridge_token`, add the `data_sources` array.
2. List your desired data sources, choosing from `payroll`, `financial_accounts`, and `docs`. The order of the elements determines the waterfall ordering.
3. You can include any or all of these in your array.

Example:

<CodeGroup>
  ```Text cURL
  curl --request POST \
       --url https://prod.truv.com/v1/users/{user_id}/tokens/ \
       --header 'X-Access-Client-Id: {{client_id}}' \
       --header 'X-Access-Secret: {{access_key}}	' \
       --header 'accept: application/json' \
       --header 'content-type: application/json' \
       --data '
  {
       "product_type": "income",
       "data_source": ["financial_accounts","payroll", "docs"],
       "tracking_info": "any data for tracking current transaction"
  }
  '
  ```
</CodeGroup>

# Smart Routing

**Smart Routing** uses Truv’s routing engine to automatically choose the data source most likely to succeed for each user. For example, it might route some users to payroll and others to financial\_accounts based on historical performance and employer policies.

## Why Use Smart Routing?

* Higher Conversion Rates: Avoid prompting users for data sources with low success rates.
* Better User Experience: Users are less likely to struggle with credentials they don’t know.
* Ongoing Optimization: Truv continuously monitors success metrics across thousands of employers and updates its routing logic accordingly.

## How It Works with a Waterfall

Smart Routing determines the first data source a user sees. If that source fails or is unavailable, the user still follows your configured waterfall sequence for any remaining sources.
