# Overview

Test and try out various scenarios using Truv. These features require no code for you to run. Get started with these sample integration solutions.

The emulator lets you view the Truv experience as a user. Each sandbox scenario offers a user context and situation for specific workflows. Simulate Truv integrations and use cases with the information from the sections below.

# Truv Emulator

Access the Truv Emulator through the [Truv Dashboard](https://dashboard.truv.com/app/home). This is a simulation of the Truv workflow. Experience Truv as a user and navigate different workflows and situations.

At the top, you can toggle **Sandbox mode** for testing various user scenarios. Additionally, the test scenarios are also available in **Production mode** with providers such as **Truv Payroll Provider**, **Truv Bank**, and **Truv Insurance Provider**, which can be accessed through the search function. View the [Sandbox scenarios section](#sandbox-scenarios) for additional details.

### Native login via mobile SDKs

Native logins in mobile SDKs in sandbox environment are available when using `Truv payroll provider`. Native login for other providers work in production mode only.

### Refreshes

Data refreshes will automatically succeed if the `goodlogin/goodpassword` credential combination is used. To test for a failed refresh, use the `goodlogin/mfa` credential combination from the initial verification. This will result in the refresh having the `mfa_error` status.

### Additional login fields

Providers may also use specific fields for login information. The points below cover these credentials for testing successful scenarios in Truv. These are the same scenarios as the `goodlogin` credentials from the table above.

* Phone number - `(111)111-1111`
* Email - `[email protected]`

## Native reset for authentication

Truv Sandbox supports authentication reset workflows in supported implementations. Follow the process below.

1. Enter values in requested fields
2. Use `goodlogin` credentials for verification during MFA

### Multi-factor authentication and re-verification

For the embedded Truv flow and Orders, borrowers may be required to go through MFA during authentication. The re-verification during an automated refresh could also require MFA and could fail as a result. For Orders, the borrower would receive a notification to re-verify. For the embedded flow, you would need to implement the appropriate steps to contact the end-user.

In order to test this scenario, please use MFA credentials in the original verification and trigger a data refresh via Truv's API.

For additional troubleshooting, view the [Data Refresh](/docs/update-mode#authentication-issues) guide for more information. For Orders, please use the [Data Refresh endpoint](/docs/orders_create_refresh_order) within [Orders](/docs/orders-api).

## Payroll data source testing

The Truv products below collecting payroll data have their own supported testing connections. View the [Supported companies for testing section](#supported-companies-for-testing) when using payroll as a data source in the supported sandbox environments.

* [Income and Employment](/docs/income-and-employment) (VOIE)
* [Employment History](/docs/employment-history) (VOE)
* [Direct Deposit Switch](/docs/direct-deposit-switch) (DDS)
* [Paycheck Linked Loans](/docs/paycheck-linked-loans) (PLL)

### Supported companies for testing

The list below contains the available information for Mapping. These companies return a `company_mapping_id` value for integration.

* **Facebook** - Workday
* **Bank of America** - Company with single sign on
* **Kroger** - Custom integration
* **Fannie Mae** - ADP
* **Freddie Mac** - Workday

<Info>
  In the emulator, only sandbox companies have the correct `company_mapping_id` value. Production environments have all valid mapping information values for many large US-based organizations and data providers.
</Info>

## Document processing testing

When testing for [Integrating Document Processing](/docs/implementing-income-and-employment-document-processing), the PDF downloads in the list below cover different scenarios for sandbox use.

Upload the documents for testing different sandbox response results. Pay statements and tax documents return data when successful. Unsuccessful uploads respond with status updates. Users and applicants require both `first_name` and `last_name` values for testing.

* Successful documents - [Most recent paystub](https://citadelid-resources.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/doc_upload/most.recent.paystub.pdf), [Next recent paystub](https://citadelid-resources.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/doc_upload/next.recent.paystub.pdf), [First paystub](https://citadelid-resources.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/doc_upload/first.paystub.pdf), [W2](https://citadelid-resources.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/doc_upload/w2.pdf)
* 1099 tax forms - [1099-DIV](https://citadelid-resources.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/doc_upload/1099div.pdf), [1099-G](https://citadelid-resources.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/doc_upload/1099g.pdf), [1099-INT](https://citadelid-resources.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/doc_upload/1099int.pdf), [1099-MISC](https://citadelid-resources.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/doc_upload/1099misc.pdf), [1099-NEC](https://citadelid-resources.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/doc_upload/1099nec.pdf), [1099-R](https://citadelid-resources.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/doc_upload/1099r.pdf), [SSA-1099](https://citadelid-resources.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/doc_upload/ssa1099.pdf)

<Info>
  For 1099 tax documents, Truv supports parsing for formatting from any year after 2021. This includes the following 1099 forms.

  * 1099-DIV, 1099-G, 1099-INT, 1099-MISC, 1099-NEC, 1099-R
</Info>

### Suspicious document detection
