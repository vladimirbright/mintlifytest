# Overview

Use the steps in the guide below to integrate Truv DDS in your application.

# Summary of the sequence diagram

The diagram below shows an overview of token and data exchanges. The sequence covers your application, Truv Bridge, your server and backend, as well as the Truv API. View the [Steps section](#steps) to get started.

1. Request a `bridge_token` value from your backend.
2. On your backend server, create a user and request a bridge token from Truv's API.
3. Initialize Truv Bridge in your application and pass the `bridge_token` to **TruvBridge.init**.
4. When a user successfully connects their account, it generates a `public_token`. Truv Bridge hands off the `public_token` to the client through the **onSuccess** callback.
5. After the connection status changes, webhook events begin to arrive.
6. Exchange the temporary `public_token` for a permanent `link_id`.
7. Make an API request to Truv to get the data.

## Authentication

<Info>
  Requests to Truv APIs *must use HTTPS with TLS 1.2v encryption or higher*.
</Info>

All API requests require the `X-Access-Client-Id` and `X-Access-Secret` headers. These contain your **Client ID** and **Access secret**. These values are in your [Truv Dashboard](https://dashboard.truv.com/app/development/keys).

<Warning>
  The **Client ID** and **Access secret** may allow access to sensitive information. Store these in a secure and private place.
</Warning>

For API requests, the base URL `https://prod.truv.com/v1/` is the same in each environment. Update the access key with the prefixes below for use with their respective environments.

* `sandbox`
* `dev`
* `prod`

## Steps

The steps below cover each action for setting up your Truv workflow.

### 1. Create a User and request a Bridge Token

Create a [User](/reference/users) in the Truv backend to link different data providers. See the sample cURL request below.

<CodeGroup>
  ```curl cURL
  curl --request POST \
       --url https://prod.truv.com/v1/users/ \
       --header 'X-Access-Client-Id: {{client_id}}' \
       --header 'X-Access-Secret: {{access_key}}	' \
       --header 'accept: application/json' \
       --header 'content-type: application/json' \
       --data '
  {
       "external_user_id": "12345",
       "first_name": "John",
       "last_name": "Doe",
       "email": "[email protected]",
       "phone": "+14155554193",
       "ssn": "222233333"
  }
  '
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  The Truv backend only allows a single user for each account in your system. However, a User may have connected with multiple Bridge Tokens and data providers. Store Truv’s User ID and related information in your database.
</Warning>

Create a [Bridge Token](/reference/bridge-token) for the User and include `product_type = deposit_switch` in the configuration.

<Info>
  When creating the `bridge_token`, include the following data fields for bank account details for Truv Direct Deposit Switch.

  * `account_number`
  * `account_type`
  * `routing_number`
  * `bank_name`
</Info>

View the cURL sample below.

<CodeGroup>
  ```curl curl
  curl --request POST \
       --url https://prod.truv.com/v1/users/{user_id}/tokens/ \
       --header 'X-Access-Client-Id: {{client_id}}' \
       --header 'X-Access-Secret: {{access_key}}	' \
       --header 'accept: application/json' \
       --header 'content-type: application/json' \
       --data '
  {
       "product_type": "deposit_switch",
       "tracking_info": "any data for tracking current connection",
       "account": {
            "account_number": "16002600",
            "account_type": "checking",
            "routing_number": "123456789",
            "bank_name": "TD Bank"
       }
  }
  '
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### 2. Initiate Truv Bridge

Using the Bridge Token, initialize the Truv Bridge in your user interface. Follow the example below and pass the [Bridge Token](/reference/bridge-token) to **TruvBridge.init**.

<CodeGroup>
  ```html html
  <script src="https://cdn.truv.com/bridge.js"></script>
  <script>
    // Step 2 - Call your back end to retrieve a bridge_token from truv
    const bridgeToken = <%= Value returned by API call to acquire bridge_token %>

    // Step 3 - Initialize Bridge
    const bridge = TruvBridge.init({
          bridgeToken: bridgeToken.bridge_token,
      })
  </script>
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### 3. Test Credentials

Test your implementation using sample credentials. Refer to [Testing](/docs/testing) or view the sample usernames and passwords below.

| Username   | Password     | Description                           |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| goodlogin  | goodpassword | Happy flow                            |
| goodlogin  | mfa          | User with multi factor authentication |
| error.user | login\_error | Incorrect login or password           |

### 4. Exchange tokens

When Users connect their accounts successfully, it creates a `public_token`. The Bridge hands off the `public_token` to the client. This uses the **onSuccess** callback after a user has successfully created a Link.

<Info>
  The `public_token` expires after six hours.
</Info>

Exchange the temporary` public_token` for a permanent `access_token` with the [Exchange Tokens endpoint](/reference/link_exchange_token_flow). The `public_token` is invalidated after exchanging for an `access_token`. View the sample JSON values below.

<CodeGroup>
  ```json json
  {
    "access_token": "48427a36d43c4d5aa6324bc06c692456",
    "link_id": "24d7e80942ce4ad58a93f70ce4115f5c",
    "link_hash": "bc917458a3da4b2c8cc8282aa1707aaa"
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### 5. Monitor webhooks

[Webhooks](/docs/webhooks) to your server can help monitor and notify you of Task status changes. Use `link_id` or `task_id` to match the webhook events with Link connections.

<CodeGroup>
  ```json json
  {
      "webhook_id": "609a82aab21e4d9ba2569f35e9e8f26a",
      "event_type": "task-status-updated",
      "updated_at": "2021-04-26T13:02:20.369267+00:00",
      "task_id": "67f2924530564282bbaf6d27655e94a4",
      "link_id": "64f8e374949c4b769706028022626bf1",
      "product": "income",
      "tracking_info": "27266f35-bb54-44c3-8905-070641a0c0aa",
      "status": "login"
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### 6. Retrieve data

Use the permanent `access_token` to generate a [Direct Deposit report](/reference/dds_report). For [Income and Employment](/reference/income_verification) is needed, refer to the [Implementation Guide](/docs/implementation-income-and-employment).

<CodeGroup>
  ```json json
  {
    "id": "24d7e80942ce4ad58a93f70ce4115f5c",
    "status": "new",
    "finished_at": "2021-04-06T11:30:00Z",
    "completed_at": "2021-04-06 11:30:00+00:00",
    "access_token": "48427a36d43c4d5aa6324bc06c692456",
    "tracking_info": "user123456",
    "deposit_details": {
      "account_number": "16002600",
      "account_type": "checking",
      "routing_number": "123456789",
      "bank_name": "TD Bank",
      "deposit_type": "percent",
      "deposit_value": "50.00"
    },
    "initial_accounts": [
      {
        "account_number": "16001234",
        "routing_number": "55999876"
      }
    ]
  ```
</CodeGroup>
