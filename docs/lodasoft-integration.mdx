# Overview

Transform your loan verification process with our seamless Truv integration in Lodasoft. Get instant access to verified employment and income data directly from source payroll systems, helping you make faster, more confident lending decisions.

# Key Benefits

Our integration delivers immediate value by providing:

* **Real-time verification** that eliminates manual documentation reviews and reduces processing time
* **Source-verified employment and income data** that minimizes fraud risk and increases accuracy
* **A streamlined borrower experience** with simple account connectivity and automated updates

# How it Works

The verification process integrates smoothly into your existing loan workflow:

* When borrowers reach the income verification stage, they have the ability to connect their payroll accounts through Truv's secure interface. This gives you instant access to their verified employment and income details.
* Your loan origination system automatically receives comprehensive Truv verification reports once accounts are connected. If borrowers skip the verification step initially, you can easily create tasks prompting them to complete it later.
* The system continuously monitors connected accounts for new payroll information, ensuring you always have the most current verification data throughout the loan process.

Truv in Lodasoft can be enabled in one of the two ways

* Embedded Truv experience for all borrowers
* Enable as a task or a To-do for borrowers
* Both of the above, i.e, show embedded Truv experience and enable task workfow

# Borrower Experience

We've designed the process to be straightforward for borrowers. They can either:

Verify their income directly through the dedicated verification section while completing their application Respond to automated task reminders in their to-do list to connect their accounts through Truv at their convenience

The system guides them through each step, making it easy to provide the verification you need while maintaining security and control over their information. CopyRetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
