# Setup overview

To enable AIM Check with Truv, follow the below steps:

1. Reach out to Truv Implementation to request enabling AIM Check
2. Configure the Custom Field data type
3. Map Truv’s aim\_check\_available to the Custom Field
4. Configure Automation Rules
5. Configure Workflow Rules

## Step 1: Reach out to Truv Implementation to request enabling AIM Check

1. Notify your Truv Implementation point of contact that you would like to enable Truv’s AIM Check solution in Encompass.

## Step 2: Configure the Custom Field data type

In Steps 2-3, we will be setting up a Custom Field in Encompass for Truv to indicate which borrowers AIM Check is available for (aim\_check\_available). In this step we will pick an unused Custom Field in Encompass and set the correct data type for the indicator.

**Configure the Custom Field data type**

1. Go to Encompass Smart Client, then navigate to Encompass → Settings → Loan Setup → Loan Custom Fields

   1. Select an unused Custom Field from the list (NONE in the Format column) and update the formatting as follows, we will use **CUST01FV**

      1. **Description**: Truv aim check report availability
      2. **Format**: STRING
      3. **Max Length**: 1000

      ![](/images/docs/bea64cbea272f1cf4661f79a0b393344872dacf294228c95f1e02b94b51dce16-image.png)

      <Warning>
        We will use **CUST01FV** as an example for the rest of this setup, if you need to use a different Custom Field just replace **CUST01FV** in this guide with your field.
      </Warning>

## Step 3: Map Truv’s aim\_check\_available to the Custom Field

**Map Truv’s indicator (*aim\_check\_available*) to the Custom Field configured in Step 2**

1. Go to [https://encompass.ice.com/admin](https://encompass.ice.com/admin), then navigate to **Services** → **Services Management**
2. Find **Truv - Verification or Income/Employment**, then click the three dots on the bottom right of the panel and select **Field Mapping**

3. On the Field Mapping page, select **Add Another** and enter the following options, then press **Save**

   1. **Encompass Field ID**: CUST01FV
      1. Note: if you used a different Custom Field in Step 2 it should be used here
   2. **Mapping Type**: Maps Between
   3. **Provider Field Name**: aim\_check\_available

  A Custom Field configured in your Encompass instance that will map to Truv's indicator for which borrowers AIM Check is available for (aim\_check\_available). It should have the string data type.
