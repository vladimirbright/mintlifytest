The Truv Emulator is a simulation of the Truv workflow. At the top, you can toggle **Sandbox mode** for testing. View the [Testing guide](/docs/testing) for more information.

## Bridge

Use the Truv Bridge tab to go through the process as a user. This configuration has pre-populated values for viewing a comprehensive experience. The left section allows you to configure various product types and configurations.
