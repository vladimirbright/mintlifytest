# Overview

Truv Bridge is a drop-in module for your users to connect their accounts to Truv. This allows you to access their data using Truv's API. Truv Bridge handles employer search, credentials, multi-factor authentication, and error handling.

Use the [Quickstart](/docs/quickstart-guide) guide to learn about Truv Bridge and start implementing Truv in your workflow.

# Summary of sequence diagram

The diagram below shows the overview of token and data exchanges. The sequence covers your application, Truv Bridge, your server and backend, as well as the Truv API. View the Steps section to get started.

1. Request a `bridge_token` value from your backend.
2. On your backend server, create a user and request a bridge token from Truv's API.
3. Initialize Truv Bridge in your application and pass the `bridge_token` to **TruvBridge.init**.
4. When a user successfully connects their account, it generates a `public_token`. Truv Bridge hands off the `public_token` to the client through the **onSuccess** or **onEvent** callback.
5. After the connection status changes, webhook events begin to arrive.
6. Exchange the temporary `public_token` for a permanent `access_token`.
7. Make an API request to Truv to get the data.

## Steps

Integrate Truv Bridge after you've collected your Client ID and Access secret values.

Truv Bridge handles credential validation, multi-factor authentication, and error handling for each supported integration. Use the steps below to get started.

1. Load the `bridge.js` library file from Truv, see the [Embedding Truv Bridge section below](#embedding-truv-bridge).
2. [Create a user](/reference/users) on your backend server, then request a [Bridge Token](/reference/bridge-token) from the API.
3. Initialize Truv Bridge with `TruvBridge.init` and use the `bridge_token` value as a parameter.

# Embedding Truv Bridge

Use [Truv's SDKs](/docs/bridge-home#libraries) to embed Truv Bridge in mobile, web apps, or both. The Javascript code below also works as a separate example.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Bridge example
  <html>
  <head>
      <!-- Step 1 - add the Bridge library to your app with a script tag -->
      <script src="https://cdn.truv.com/bridge.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
  <script>
    // Step 2 - Call your back end to retrieve a bridge_token from truv
    const bridgeToken = <%= Value returned by API call to acquire bridge_token %>

    // Step 3 - Initialize Bridge
    const bridge = TruvBridge.init({
          bridgeToken: bridgeToken.bridge_token,
          onLoad:function(){
            // Optional, called when Bridge loads
            console.log('Bridge loaded')
          },
          onSuccess:function(public_token, metadata){
            console.log('success handler')
            // Send the public_token to your server to exchange for an access_token
            // and retrieve payroll data.
            // The metadata object contains info about the Link.
            console.log("token: ", public_token)
            console.log("metadata: ", metadata)
          },
          onEvent: function(event_type, payload) {
            // all events fire this function. event_type indicates what the event is,
            // payload has additional information depending on the event.
            console.log('event: ', event_type)
            console.log('payload: ', payload)
          },
          onClose:function(){
            // Optional, called when Bridge is closed by the user.
            console.log('Bridge closed')
          }
      })
  </script>
  <!-- Normal page content -->
  <!-- Step 4 - Create a button or action that calls bridge.open() to Bridge -->
  <button type="button" id="button" onclick="bridge.open()">
    Connect
  </button>
  </body>
  </html>
  ```

# Authentication

Truv Bridge is for authorized environments only. Confirm your application's request with your Client ID and Access secret values for security. Initialize Truv Bridge with the valid bridge\_token value for `TruvBridge.init` to continue.

# Parameters

The table covers the required parameter for Truv Bridge.

| Property    | Description                                                                                                                  | Required |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| bridgeToken | Returned bridge\_token value from [Create Bridge Token](/reference/users_tokens) endpoint                                    | required |
| position    | Determines how the bridge is displayed. The behavior by default is **Dialog**, see [Position parameter](#position-parameter) | optional |

## Position parameter

Determines how the bridge is displayed. The default type is [Dialog](#dialog).

### Dialog

The bridge appears as a dialog window, which overlays the rest of the interface and disables scrolling.

`{ type: 'dialog' }`

### Inline

The bridge is integrated within an existing element, allowing the interface to function without blocking the rest of the interface or global scrolling. However, it's crucial to ensure that your interface functions seamlessly across various devices, particularly on mobile devices such as iPhones and Androids, including compatibility with virtual keyboards.

`{ type: 'inline', container: HTMLElement }`

### Example

Simple call to `TruvBridge.init`

<CodeGroup>
  ```json json
  const bridge = TruvBridge.init({  
          bridgeToken: bridgeToken.bridge_token,  
          position: {  
            type: 'inline',  
            container: document.querySelector('#bridge-container')  
          },  
          onSuccess:function(public_token, metadata){  
          }  
  })
  ```
</CodeGroup>

# Callbacks

The functions in this table cover specific actions.

| Callback  | Description                                                                                                                                      | Required |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| onSuccess | User has successfully connected to a payroll provider and closed Bridge, function expects two arguments, the public\_token and a metadata object | required |
| onLoad    | Truv Bridge has finished loading                                                                                                                 | optional |
| onEvent   | Specific event occurs with Truv Bridge, see [Event Reference for Truv Bridge](/docs/event-reference-for-truv-bridge)                             | optional |
| onClose   | Truv Bridge closes                                                                                                                               | optional |

# Closing Truv Bridge

Close Truv Bridge programmatically with the `close` method. This is from the Truv Bridge instance returned by `init` function.

The default behavior for Truv Bridge to close is with user input.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript javascript
  // call close method of the bridge instance
  bridge.close();
  ```
</CodeGroup>
