# Overview

Truv's integration with Floify streamlines the verification process by allowing users to quickly access and authenticate employment and income details. This integration ensures that all borrower data is sourced from reliable accounts, enhancing the accuracy and speed of your decision-making.

# Key Benefits

* **Efficient Verification**: Easily verify employment and income details
* **Reliable Data**: Obtain accurate information and necessary documentation from trusted sources.
* **Accelerated Process**: Speed up the verification process for faster, more informed decisions.

# How it works

During the pre-application stage, borrowers or co-borrowers will be prompted to connect their payroll accounts and share their income and employment information through Truv.

1. **Borrower Connection**: Borrowers link their payroll accounts using Truv.
2. **Report Generation**: Once accounts are connected, Truv generates verification reports. These reports, along with relevant payroll documents (e.g., pay stubs, W-2s, employer reports), are available in the Loan Origination System (LOS), such as Encompass®, and are added to the eFolder.
3. **Ongoing Monitoring**: Connected accounts are continuously monitored for new payroll documents, allowing for the generation of updated verification reports throughout the mortgage loan origination process.
