# Evaluate your current process

Financial Account Aggregation collects financial data from user's account. Truv retrieves identity, accounts, and transaction data from a financial institution. You can use that data throughout the application process for your users.

* **Pre-qualification** - Check eligibility for loan pre-qualification or access a fintech application.
* **Verification** - Verify users income and spending after pre-qualification, underwriting decisioning, or both.
* **Continuous access** - Use Truv for consistent access to transaction data. This makes it simpler to automatically update your system.
