# Overview

Integrating Truv with BeSmartee allows you to instantly access and verify borrowers' employment and income details from authenticated sources. This integration enhances the accuracy and speed of the verification process, facilitating quicker loan decisions.

# Key Benefits

* **Fast Verification**: Quickly verify employment and income information.
* **Reliable Data**: Access accurate data from trusted sources.
* **Efficient Processing**: Streamline the verification process for faster decision-making.

# How it works

During the pre-application phase, borrowers or co-borrowers are prompted to connect their payroll accounts using the Verify Income section of their loan application via Truv. Here’s how the process unfolds:

1. **Connect Payroll Accounts**: Borrowers link their payroll accounts through Truv to share their income and employment details.
2. **Access Reports**: Once accounts are connected, Truv reports are made available in your chosen Loan Origination System (LOS).
3. **Task Management**: If the Verify Income step is skipped, you can set up tasks for borrowers or co-borrowers to complete this verification later.
4. **Ongoing Monitoring**: Connected accounts are continuously monitored for new payroll documents, allowing for up-to-date verification reports throughout the loan origination process.

# Borrower Workflow using Truv in BeSmartee

Borrowers will enter their employment and income information and use the **"Verify Income"** section of the application. Alternatively, they will receive tasks in their TO-DO list prompting them to connect their accounts using Truv.
