# Monitoring Truv Verification Status

After the applicant completes the verification, go to **Workspace**, then **Vendor summary**, then search Truv. Select the link under the Vendor column. Find results under the **Employer-provided information** section.

Orders must be in `Pending Review` status for retrieval. Find verification data under **Employer-Provided Information**. If the applicant successfully completed the request using the Truv widget, the **New Dispatched Order** state changes to `Pending Review`.

## Managing order expirations and missing emails

### Expired Orders

Expired orders have a status of `Pending Review`.

### Missing Email in application

If an order is submitted without the applicant’s email, then you’ll see a status of `ERROR` and the Name value as `EMAIL, MISSING`. Select **Vendor** as **Truv** under the **Workplace** tab, then **Vendor Summary**. When you select `EMAIL, MISSING`, find the error message as a Warning.
