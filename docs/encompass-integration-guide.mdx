# How it works

# Encompass® Admin setup

Follow the [step-by-step detailed Encompass® set up guide for utilizing Truv within the Encompass®](/docs/enable-truv-in-ice-encompass) platform. To begin with the setup, first choose the workflow that fits the needs of your organization. You have the option to choose from:

1. Automated Service Ordering (ASO) within Encompass®
2. Manual Ordering within Encompass®

## 1. Encompass® Automated Service Ordering (ASO)

Encompass® (desktop and web editions) offers support for automatic service orders (ASO) when a loan fulfills certain conditions. This is referred to as Automated Service Ordering or ASO. Any Encompass® Partner Connect, EPC integration can be configured by a lender administrator to submit automated orders. This powerful feature is designed to reduce the manual workload for lenders' personnel.

Loans that do not meet the ASO conditions or criteria are automatically placed in Manual orders for loan personnel to review and place orders manually.
