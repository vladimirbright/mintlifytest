# Insurance provider search

Truv simplifies connecting your users to their insurance provider. Use the strategies below for your process.

* Without your user’s insurance provider information -> Use Truv’s default search
* With your user’s insurance provider information -> [Deeplink](/docs/deeplinking) directly to login

## Using Truv's search

Truv Bridge is a new way to verify insurance history. This lets users connect to their insurance provider for the first time.

Users can select their provider in Truv from the insurance provider list or look for their insurance provider in the search field at the top of the screen.

## Building your own search with deeplinking

With your user’s insurance provider information, deeplink users directly to the login input screen. Use that data to let users skip the search screen in the widget.

In addition, you can use the [List all data providers endpoint](/reference/providers-list) to search for `insurance` product type queries. You can then pass the correct insurance provider data to Truv Bridge. Once the user confirms the information, direct them to the insurance provider login screen.

# Routing the user after login

Depending on the connection results, users can be routed to the success screen or return to select other verification options.

## Successful connection

The two points below are common options to direct the user after they successfully log in.

* Show users the status for the successful connection

  * Use Webhooks or poll Truv’s backend API for status
  * Allow users to close Truv Bridge after logging in
  * Faster solution for users

* Wait for updates when gathering and parsing basic insurance provider information

  * Show success when completed
  * Easier solution for developers
