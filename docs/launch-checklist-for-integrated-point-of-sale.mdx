# Overview

The Launch Checklist is designed to guide you through the process of integrating Truv’s verification services into your Point-of-Sale System(POS).

It outlines the key steps for setup, configuration, activation, testing, and post-launch activities to ensure a seamless integration. Use this guide to develop and launch an integration using Truv in your Point-of-Sale systems.

# Milestone 1: Setup POS

## One-Time Admin Setup:

* Enable Truv as a verification service in the POS of your choice.
* Configure the service and authorize users.
* Add or enable authorized users to access Truv.
* Input Truv API credentials into the POS.

## Configure Truv Settings in POS:

* Ensure Truv webhooks are configured.
* Activate the Truv service in POS.
* Allow to show **Pending Tasks** to borrowers/co-borrowers for when they skip the verification step.

# Milestone 2: Customize & test

## Add Templates in Truv Dashboard

* Customize branding, returned documents- number of paystubs and W2.
* Enable Truv's document upload as a fallback.
* Ensure to  **retrieve entitlements from the respective LOS**to write into **Truv's D1C and LPA report id** field.

Refer to the [detailed step-by-step guide to set up templates](/docs/customization-templates) in Truv Dashboard.

## Testing in a Sandbox Environment:
