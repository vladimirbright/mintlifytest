Customize Order expiration using the Truv Dashboard. Go to **Settings**, then **Branding**, `Field Name: link_expiry`. The Order will expire and the status is marked as `Expired` in Orders. Borrowers then cannot use the generated link to complete the verification.

The status column reflects the all associated status updates. If an Order has multiple employments, borrowers receive email reminders. Email reminder frequency is every 24 hours for three business days by default. The option to unsubscribe is also available.

<Info>

## Re-verification or Refresh the data

Truv provides you with the optionality to re-verify or refresh the data. Refresh completed VOE or VOIE reports with today’s income and employment information. Select the **Refresh the data** action to initiate the request. After submitting, the status changes to `Pending`. The new report with updated data is available when complete.

To order a re-verification complete the below steps:

* Navigate to the Truv Instance within Encompass®.

* Once you have selected the loan select the order that you wish to re-verify.

* Click on `Refresh the data` to proceed with the re-verification.

  * Truv always does a backend refresh to pull the request verification.
  * In some cases, Truv needs borrower to re-authenticate. In such cases, Truv notifies the borrower to re-authenticate into the specified employers.
  * While ordering a re-verification you have the option to select a Employment only verification for the 10-day PCV or request a full Income and Employment re-verification.
  * Truv also provides the optionality for your teams to select from current and prior employments for the borrower or co-borrower.
  * All of the returned documents are automatically uploaded to the Encompass® eFolder based on your configurations.

## Download the reports

View completed VOE or VOIE reports by selecting **Download** button on the **Order statuses** tab. If the order request includes multiple employments, separate PDFs are generated.

<Info>
  If the borrower needs to verify multiple employments, the status will remain `pending` until all employers are verified. The PDF Truv report, including the Report ID, will only be generated once the entire Truv Order is completed, expired, or cancelled.
</Info>

## Partial Verifications

If the borrower does not verify all employments and the order is expired or cancelled, Truv will generate a report with a Report ID for the verified employer(s).

## Cancel an Order

Ordered requests can be cancelled by selecting **Cancel order** button. This is only possible after an Order is created and in `Pending` status. Completed and expired orders cannot be cancelled.
