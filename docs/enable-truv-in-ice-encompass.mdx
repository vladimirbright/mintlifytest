# Overview

Truv helps loan officers and processors submit income and employment verification requests on behalf of borrowers. Now with Encompass® integrations, customers retrieve and refresh aggregate reports and store them in the Encompass® eFolder during the mortgage loan origination process.

# One time Set up Guide

Log into Encompass® as an administrator using [Encompass® Web](https://encompassloconnect.com). Navigate to the **Admin** tab at the top of the screen, select **Services** on the left navigation. Select **Services Management** and then **Add Service** on the right.

<Info>
  Truv has three environments, sandbox, development, and production. Each requires an associated Access secret for their respective uses. *Sandbox* is for checking structure and getting sample data, *Development* is a production-like environment for end to end testing. Confirm your configurations in these environments before moving to Production. Test verifications in the development environment are not billed or limited. For sandbox data, please refer to Truv's [Testing](/docs/testing) page.

## Step 5: Enter Truv Credentials into Encompass®

#### **Additional Configuration Settings**

* **Don't update employment data**: When checked, this feature allows the Truv verification to be uploaded into Encompass® without overwriting the existing employment information in Form 1003. For some customers, it is important to upload the Truv report, paystubs, and W-2s without modifying the existing data in Encompass®.
* **Don't send SMS**: When checked, Truv will not send any SMS notifications to the borrower.
* **Hide VOE/VOIE report for doc upload**: When a Truv verification is successful, the Truv report, along with the paystubs and W-2s, is uploaded into Encompass®. However, for some customers, if the connection to the payroll provider is unsuccessful, manual document uploads require additional checks. In such cases, they prefer not to upload the Truv report, as it may give a false sense of verification. Instead, they only want the manually uploaded documents to be added to Encompass® for the lender's review.
* **Don't upload paystubs**: When checked, PDF paystubs will not be uploaded to Encompass®.
* **Don't upload W2**: When checked, PDF W2s will not be uploaded to Encompass®.
* **Don't upload 1099**: When checked, PDF 1099s will not be uploaded to Encompass®.
* **Don't upload Truv's report**: When checked, the PDF Truv report will not be uploaded to Encompass®.

## Step 6: Toggle to go-live

Activate the Truv Verification by toggling the **Status** button for the service setup. If the `client_id` and `access_secret` are incorrect, an error message appears when creating an Order.
