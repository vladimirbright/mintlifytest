# Overview

Follow the step-by-step guide below to use Truv in your application for paycheck linked lending.

# Summary of sequence diagram

The diagram below shows the overview of token and data exchanges. The sequence covers your application, Truv Bridge, your server and backend, as well as the Truv API. View [the Steps section](#steps) to get started.

1. Request a `bridge_token` value from your backend.
2. On your backend server, create a user and request a bridge token from Truv's API.
3. Initialize Truv Bridge in your application and pass the `bridge_token` to **TruvBridge.init**.
4. When a user successfully connects their account, it generates a `public_token`. Truv Bridge hands off the `public_token` to the client through the **onSuccess** callback.
5. After the connection status changes, webhook events begin to arrive.
6. Exchange the temporary `public_token` for a permanent `link_id`.
7. Make an API request to Truv to get the data.

## Authentication

<Info>
  Requests to Truv APIs *must use HTTPS with TLS 1.2v encryption or higher*.
</Info>

All API requests require the `X-Access-Client-Id` and `X-Access-Secret` headers. These contain your **Client ID** and **Access secret**. These values are in your [Truv Dashboard](https://dashboard.truv.com/app/development/keys).

<Warning>
  The **Client ID** and **Access secret** may allow access to sensitive information. Store these in a secure and private place.
</Warning>

For API requests, the base URL `https://prod.truv.com/v1/` is the same in each environment. Update the access key with the prefixes below for use with their respective environments.

* `sandbox`
* `dev`
* `prod`

## Steps

The steps below cover each action for setting up your Truv workflow.

### 1. Create a User and request a Bridge Token

Create a [User](/reference/users) in the Truv backend to link different data providers. See the sample cURL request below.

<CodeGroup>
  ```curl cURL
  curl --request POST \
       --url https://prod.truv.com/v1/users/ \
       --header 'X-Access-Client-Id: {{client_id}}' \
       --header 'X-Access-Secret: {{access_key}}	' \
       --header 'accept: application/json' \
       --header 'content-type: application/json' \
       --data '
  {
       "external_user_id": "12345",
       "first_name": "John",
       "last_name": "Doe",
       "email": "[email protected]",
       "phone": "+14155554193",
       "ssn": "222233333"
  }
  '
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  The Truv backend only allows a single user for each account in your system. However, a User may have connected with multiple Bridge Tokens and data providers. Store Truv’s User ID and related information in your database.
</Warning>

Create a [Bridge Token](/reference/bridge-token) for the User and include `product_type = all` in the configuration. View the cURL sample below.

<Info>
  When creating the `bridge_token`, include the following data fields for bank account details for Truv Paycheck Linked Loans.

  * `account_number`

  * `account_type`

  * `routing_number`

  * `bank_name`

  * `deposit_type`

    * `amount` - fixed amount from the paycheck
    * `deposit_value` - amount in dollars
</Info>

<CodeGroup>
  ```curl curl
  curl --request POST \
       --url https://prod.truv.com/v1/users/{user_id}/tokens/ \
       --header 'X-Access-Client-Id: {{client_id}}' \
       --header 'X-Access-Secret: {{access_key}}	' \
       --header 'accept: application/json' \
       --header 'content-type: application/json' \
       --data '
  {
       "product_type": "pll",
       "tracking_info": "any data for tracking current connection",
       "account": {
            "account_number": "16002600",
            "account_type": "checking",
            "routing_number": "123456789",
            "bank_name": "TD Bank",
            "deposit_type": "amount",
            "deposit_value": "100"
       }
  }
  '
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### 2. Initiate Truv Bridge

Using the Bridge Token, initialize the Truv Bridge in your user interface. Follow the example below and pass the [Bridge Token](/reference/bridge-token) to **TruvBridge.init**.

<CodeGroup>
  ```html html
  <script src="https://cdn.truv.com/bridge.js"></script>
  <script>
    // Step 2 - Call your back end to retrieve a bridge_token from truv
    const bridgeToken = <%= Value returned by API call to acquire bridge_token %>

    // Step 3 - Initialize Bridge
    const bridge = TruvBridge.init({
          bridgeToken: bridgeToken.bridge_token,
      })
  </script>
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### 3. Test Credentials

Test your implementation using sample credentials. Refer to [Testing](/docs/testing) or view the sample usernames and passwords below.

| Username   | Password     | Description                           |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| goodlogin  | goodpassword | Full time current employment          |
| goodlogin  | mfa          | User with multi factor authentication |
| error.user | login\_error | Incorrect login or password           |

### 4. Exchange tokens

When Users connect their accounts successfully, it creates a `public_token`. The Bridge hands off the `public_token` to the client. This uses the **onSuccess** callback after a user has successfully created a Link.

<Info>
  The `public_token` expires after six hours.
</Info>

Exchange the temporary` public_token` for a permanent `access_token` with the [Exchange Tokens endpoint](/reference/link_exchange_token_flow). The `public_token` is invalidated after exchanging for an `access_token`. View the sample JSON values below.

<CodeGroup>
  ```json json
  {
    "access_token": "48427a36d43c4d5aa6324bc06c692456",
    "link_id": "24d7e80942ce4ad58a93f70ce4115f5c",
    "link_hash": "bc917458a3da4b2c8cc8282aa1707aaa"
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### 5. Monitor webhooks

[Webhooks](/docs/webhooks) to your server can help monitor and notify you of Task status changes. Use `link_id` or `task_id` to match the webhook events with Link connections.

<CodeGroup>
  ```json json
  {
      "webhook_id": "609a82aab21e4d9ba2569f35e9e8f26a",
      "event_type": "task-status-updated",
      "updated_at": "2021-04-26T13:02:20.369267+00:00",
      "task_id": "67f2924530564282bbaf6d27655e94a4",
      "link_id": "64f8e374949c4b769706028022626bf1",
      "product": "income",
      "tracking_info": "27266f35-bb54-44c3-8905-070641a0c0aa",
      "status": "login"
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### 6. Retrieve data

Use the permanent `access_token` to generate a [Paycheck Linked Loan](/reference/pll_report) report . For [Income and Employment](/reference/income_verification) needs, refer to the [VOIE Implementation Guide](/docs/implementation-income-and-employment). View the sample response below.

<CodeGroup>
  ```json json
  {
    "id": "24d7e80942ce4ad58a93f70ce4115f5c",
    "status": "new",
    "finished_at": "2021-04-06T11:30:00Z",
    "completed_at": "2021-04-06 11:30:00+00:00",
    "access_token": "48427a36d43c4d5aa6324bc06c692456",
    "tracking_info": "user123456",
    "deposit_details": {
      "account_number": "16002600",
      "account_type": "checking",
      "routing_number": "123456789",
      "bank_name": "TD Bank",
      "deposit_type": "amount",
      "deposit_value": "50.00"
    },
    "initial_accounts": [
      {
        "account_number": "16001234",
        "routing_number": "55999876"
      }
    ]
  ```
</CodeGroup>

# Refresh or Continuous Access

Continuous Access allows you to refresh data on a fixed schedule. This reduces the need for users to re-authenticate. When new or updated data is available, Truv sends [webhook](/docs/webhooks) events on updated information. This can include changes in bank accounts, direct deposit account allocations, employment status, income, shifts, as well as statement data.

To use continuous access for your account, [contact Truv Support to get started](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7c0f090c0c130e083c080e090a521f1311).

<Info>
  Depending on the payroll system, user authentication may expire. For multi-factor authentication or one-time passcode (OTP) configurations, [users may need to re-authenticate ](/docs/update-mode#handling-data-refresh-authentication-issues)before data monitoring can continue.
</Info>

Trigger data refreshes from the backend with the [Data Refresh endpoint](/reference/data-refresh). Use the [Data Refresh Mode guide](/docs/update-mode) for more information on incomplete refreshes.

[Deleting the Link](/reference/delete_link_by_link_id) also removes all associated data for a specific user when disconnecting.
